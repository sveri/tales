Now that defined the basic building blocks we will put it all together and deliver the missing bits. 

## core.cljs

<https://github.com/sveri/omtet/blob/single\_player\_0.1/resources/templates/tetris/index.html>

Here we have the UI defined. It just draws the canvas and the score div. It is also responsible for drawing any
updates to the UI.

## handlers.cljs

<https://github.com/sveri/omtet/blob/single\_player\_0.1/src/cljs/de/sveri/omtet/tetris/handlers.cljs>

Here we defined all the handlers that act whenever an event occurs.  
One thing I did not explain yet are these lines: 

    (defn grid-changed-mw [app-state]
      (minios/draw-grid (:grid-state app-state) (:ctx app-state)))
      
    (register-handler
      :...
      (rf/after grid-changed-mw)

This calls the middleware function _after_ from re-frame which will execute the given function after the 
register-handler was executed. In this case we will draw the grid everytime it did change, or if we assume it did 
change.

## subs.cljs

<https://github.com/sveri/omtet/blob/single\_player\_0.1/src/cljs/de/sveri/omtet/tetris/subs.cljs>

Here you find the subcriptions for every time a specified app state changes.

## tetriminios.cljs

<https://github.com/sveri/omtet/blob/single\_player\_0.1/src/cljs/de/sveri/omtet/tetris/tetriminios.cljs>

And here you can see the business logic for the tetris related stuff.
