This week Rich Hickey announced the release of clojure.spec which is a new namespace in the clojure library. It
aims to provide runtime contracts for clojure.

There is already an awful lot of great documentation available:

* About: http://clojure.org/about/spec
* Guide: http://clojure.org/guides/spec 
* API: http://clojure.github.io/clojure/branch-master/clojure.spec-api.html

clojure.spec is part of the 1.9 release of which there currently 1.9.0-alpha3 is available. There is no timeframe
of a final 1.9 release yet, so it is all in a very early stage. However, considering this, the documentation is ready for primetime, 
at least from my point of view.
