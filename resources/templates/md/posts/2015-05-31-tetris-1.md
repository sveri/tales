# Tetris Part 1

In the last few weeks I took some time to code tetris with clojurescript and re-frame following this guide: 
[Tetris in HTML5 for noob](http://www.drewbuck.com/tetris-in-html5-for-noobs/).  
I will write a small series following the same pattern showing how it is done in cljs. What I will not do is explain
basic things like the original author did, but instead focus more on the differences between javascript and 
clojurescript.
