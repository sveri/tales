## App State

There is a big conceptual difference between javasrcipt and clojurescript (especially in re-frame). Whereas in 
javascript you can have as much global state as you want it is discouraged to do so in the cljs-sphere. It
is generally advised to have one to a few atoms containing your global application state.  
In re-frame it is even more better, you don't declare an atom or global state at all, it is managed by re-frame 
completely.

In re-frame there is data flowing in events, this is the general idea, for a very complete documentation, please
look here: [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)

First we will initialize the app state. As you saw in part 2 there is already a call to the dispatch function
doing that: **(rf/dispatch [:initialise-db])**.

Now we will add a new file **handlers.cljs** with the following content:



## Basic Drawing 

Next we will write the function to do some drawing
