My name is Sven Richter and I publish on this blog from time to time. My interests are mostly computer related, but 
they tend to go to politics or into funny things from time to time too.

You can find my resume here: <https://github.com/sveri/curriculum-vitae>

If you find me interesting or want to know something or just chit chat about things, feel free to drop me a mail at
blog@sveri.de.
