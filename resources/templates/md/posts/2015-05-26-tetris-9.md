Now we need to define what happens every "round" of the game. In Tetris this just means that the current active
tetriminio will drop by 1 on the y axis until it reaches the bottom or another tetriminion on the grid.  
For this we have three functions. 

_move-tick_ will check if the tetriminion is allowed to move one step down and if so, moves it one step down

    (defn- move-tick [app-state]
      (let [cur-active (:cur-active app-state)
            cur-grid (:grid-state app-state)
            remove-cur-grid (minios/draw-tet cur-active minios/tet-recipe 0 cur-grid)]    
        (if (minios/is-move-allowed? (update-in cur-active [:y] + 1) cur-active remove-cur-grid minios/tet-recipe)
          (let [moved-active (update-in cur-active [:y] + 1)
                moved-grid (minios/draw-tet moved-active minios/tet-recipe 1 remove-cur-grid)]
            (assoc app-state :grid-state moved-grid :cur-active moved-active))
          (let [new-act (minios/get-rand-tetriminio)]
            (if (minios/is-move-allowed? (update-in new-act [:y] + 1) cur-active cur-grid minios/tet-recipe)
              (assoc app-state :cur-active new-act)
              (do (dispatch [:game-over]) app-state))))))

_check-lvl_ just checks if a level up is reached and if so, increases the level count and decreases the timer.
              
    
    (defn check-lvl [app-state new-points]
      (when (< (* 10 (:lvl app-state)) (+ new-points (:score app-state))) (dispatch [:next-lvl])))



    (register-handler
      :game-sec-tick
      (rf/after grid-changed-mw)
      (fn [app-state]
        (let [moved-app-state (move-tick app-state)
              new-points (minios/count-points (:grid-state moved-app-state))]
          (check-lvl moved-app-state new-points)
          (update-in
            (assoc moved-app-state :grid-state (minios/remove-full-lines (:grid-state moved-app-state)))
            [:score] + new-points))))
