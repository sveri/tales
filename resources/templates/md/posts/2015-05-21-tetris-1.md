# Introduction

In the last few weeks I took some time to code tetris with clojurescript and re-frame following this guide: 
[Tetris in HTML5 for noobs](http://www.drewbuck.com/tetris-in-html5-for-noobs/).  
I will write a small series following the same pattern showing how it is done in cljs. What I will not do is explain
basic things like the original author did, but instead focus more on the differences between javascript and 
clojurescript.

For every beginner I recommend following Drews tutorial as he is more in depth about the basics of everything.

A big thanks to the original author [Drew Buck](http://www.drewbuck.com/about/) that got showed how to make tetris 
work with the HTML 5 canvas feature!
