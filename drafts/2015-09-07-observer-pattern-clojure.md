## Disclaimer

This is the second part of an ongoing series. I am currently working through Head First Design Patterns to refresh my
memory and while the examples are mostly in Java I want to take a look at them and see how to code them in clojure.  
That said, most people want to argue that `design patterns` are not mostly not needed in a functional programming 
language. But for me a `design pattern` is an idea or a concept and both of these can be coded in any language and
here I will show how.  
That aside, please be aware that it is often impossible to translate object oriented patterns into a functional 
style, hence, what you see here are approaches or examples that you can use, but only a subset of them. 

## Definition

its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Java Implementation

In the book we have
